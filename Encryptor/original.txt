Young Danny Fenton, he was just 14,
When his parents built a very strange machine.
It was designed to view, a world unseen.
(He's gonna catch em all 'cause he's Danny Phantom.)
When it didn't quite work, his folks, they just quit,
But then Danny took a look inside of it,
There was a great big flash, everything just changed,
His molecules got all rearranged!
(Phantom, Phantom)
When he first woke up, he realized,
He had snow white hair, and glowin' green eyes.
He could walk through walls, disappear, and fly,
He was much more unique than the other guys.
And it was then that he knew what he had to do,
He had to stop all the ghosts that were comin' through,
He's here to fight, for me and you!
He's gonna catch 'em all, 'cause he's Danny Phantom,
Gonna catch 'em all, 'cause he's Danny Phantom,
Gonna catch 'em all, 'cause he's (Danny Phantom.)
